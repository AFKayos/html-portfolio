<h1>Best Modern Horror Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 recommended movies so far.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Barbarian (2022)</h3>
<p>American horror thriller film written and directed by Zach Cregger. Beautiful cinematography, beautifully written that keeps you invest throughout. Worth the watch! </p>
<h3>Get Out (2017)</h3>
<p>American psychological horror film written, co-produced, and directed by Jordan Peele. A point of view not really explored in the horror genre and a great social commentary on the black experience in North America. A must see!</p>
<h3>The Babadook (2014)</h3>
<p>Australian psychological horror film written and directed by Jennifer Kent. A complex relationship between a mother and a children's book. Will have you hiding under the covers!</p>
